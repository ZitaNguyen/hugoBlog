Starting from an education industry (English linguistics and literature) to business industry (project management) and now technology industry (programming), I find myself evolve every day with knowledge and challenges. Thanks to the Internet and anynomous friends who generously share their expertise by blogs, YouTube, etc., I can start my coding journey at the age of 35.

I'm journaling my journey here and hope it may help someone else... Happy coding!!!

Some of my favorite quotes to share.

>
> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. ~ Lao Tzu

> If you really want to do something, you'll find a way. If you don't you find an excuse. ~ Jim Rohn
